# Product Definition Record (PDR)
## GenLite: Lightweight Offline AI Assistant

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Product Owner:** Flutter Engineering Team  

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### The Gap
In today's AI landscape, users are increasingly dependent on cloud-based AI services that require constant internet connectivity, raise privacy concerns, and often have usage limitations or costs. While powerful, these services create several pain points:

- **Privacy Vulnerabilities**: User conversations and data are processed on external servers
- **Internet Dependency**: AI assistance becomes unavailable in offline scenarios (airplanes, remote areas, poor connectivity)
- **Cost Barriers**: Subscription fees and pay-per-use models limit accessibility
- **Data Sovereignty**: Users lose control over their data and conversation history
- **Latency Issues**: Network-dependent responses can be slow or unreliable

### Why GenLite Matters
GenLite addresses these fundamental limitations by bringing AI capabilities directly to users' devices. It represents a paradigm shift from cloud-dependent AI to truly personal, private, and portable AI assistance.

**Core Value Proposition**: 
> "Your AI assistant, running entirely on your device. No internet required. No data shared. No ongoing costs."
